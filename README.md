# Hello-world
First repository where i will learn how to get start in GitGub.

this is my first branch, writing here will add some features to this branch which can be added later on to master branch after full review process.  
Whatever is being written by me is called commting (just like comminting some changes), unneccassary technical name.

Last time i missed to see the changes  i made. i want to review them myselg, hope this time i will be able to do it correctly.
